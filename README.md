# React / SASS / Webpack template

A basic application template/boilerplate that utilises [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Getting started

It's so easy to get started, just clone onto your local machine and access the cloned directory

```bash
mkdir new-proj
git clone https://github.com/teeko-k/react-sass-template new-proj
cd new-proj
```

Happy Hacking!
